# Detailed view of the game

The project has been developed as a way to test soft skills, thus it is only one time play for every user.

## Completion of the game

- The game meant to test the soft skills, thus keeping user stuck on level for ever with no form of rescue is futile.

- To avoid this *Special actions:* **skip** and **End Game**, are available at each stage so user can skip the stage by discarding the points or end the game if required.

## General Instructions for the game are as follows:

- The purpose of this game set is to evaluate your soft skills

- We recommend completing all games in one sitting, as the game is designed to be played only once

- Points are awarded for correct answers and time taken to solve each game

- The timer will not be visible on screen

- In the event of an emergency such as a power outage, technical difficulties, or network issues, you may resume the game from where you left off

- Timer will continue on the server but your progress won't be lost

- Please be attentive to all information presented in the game

- If you find yourself at a dead end, you can choose to review the previous stage, which may provide clues to help you progress past the current stage

- If necessary, you have the option to skip a stage, though this will result in forfeiting any potential points for that stage

- You may end the game at any time, regardless of what stage you are on and receive results till there
